    <h1>Look at the console ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜†</h1>

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        const team = players;

        team[3] = "Lux"

        console.log(team);
    
        // however what happens when we update that array?    
        // now here is the problem!    
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!    
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!    
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice()
      
    
        // one way    
        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // with Objects
